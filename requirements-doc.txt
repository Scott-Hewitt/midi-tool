MIDI Melody & Chord Generator - Requirements Documentation

1. Project Overview

The MIDI Melody & Chord Generator is a web application designed to create musical content programmatically. Users can generate melodies and matching chord progressions, customize various musical parameters, and export the results as MIDI files for use in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). The application aims to assist musicians, producers, and composers in the creative process by providing a tool for musical idea generation and experimentation.
