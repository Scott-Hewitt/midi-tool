## Why I Built This

As a musician and developer, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of music and technology. I created this tool to bridge the gap between music theory and digital music production, making it easier for musicians of all skill levels to experiment with melodies and chord progressions. The app serves as both a creative tool for experienced musicians and a learning resource for those new to music theory.

- **üéµ Chord Generator**: Generate chord progressions in various keys with common progression patterns
  - Select from popular progression patterns (Pop, Jazz, Blues, etc.)
  - Apply voice leading for smoother transitions
  - Use inversions and extended chords for richer harmonies
  - Visualize chord voicings and relationships

- **üëÅÔ∏è Visualization**: View a visual representation of your melodies and chord progressions
